# Projects

The `projects/` folder contains completed small projects that demonstrate the practical application of concepts learned throughout my FreeCodeCamp learning journey. Each project is designed to reinforce my understanding of HTML and CSSwhile also showcasing my ability to create functional and visually appealing web pages.

## 📌 Purpose

* Apply theoretical knowledge from workshops into real-world project scenarios
* Develop hands-on experience in building responsive and interactive web pages
* Demonstrate proficiency in structuring, styling, and organizing web content
* Showcase progress and growth as a web developer

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* HTML5 – For structuring web content
* CSS3 – For styling and layout design
* Git & GitHub – For version control and project management

## 📂 Folder Structure

The `projects/` folder is organized by individual project names for clarity and ease of navigation:

* Each project has its own folder containing all necessary files such as HTML and CSS
* Projects are labeled descriptively to indicate their purpose or functionality
* Comments in the code provide explanations for key implementation details and design decisions

This structure ensures that each project is self-contained, easy to explore, and demonstrates both the learning process and practical outcomes of my FreeCodeCamp experience.
